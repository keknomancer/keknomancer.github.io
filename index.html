                    My name is Seth Edwards. I am a businessman mainly dealing in the sales & service of computers.
                    Though my main focus is
                    computers, my skill set is extremely flexible, as you will see below.

                In the 1970s, if you happened to catch the eye of a big tech corp, they would literally buy you a house and a car and a
                ticket to whatever place the company operated out of to have you. Now, you have to bust your ass just to get an interview for a job that
                pays a quarter of what it did then, with 10x the responsibilities because the offices that account for 75% of the business' overhead
                are too inefficient to actually do what they're supposed to. Additionally, if you do have to move for the job, that's on you.
                
                Develop a chronic illness as a result of busting your ass for years? You get replaced immediately. Supervisor won't do his job?
                Now you do his job too. And what do you get after 5 years of that? Another $5k a year. After 30? You're lucky if you get a pension.
                Now everything is 2x as expensive as it was a few years ago, and inflation is more than the laughable pay increases you get. 
                
                They make the rules, so don't play the game. THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS. I don't care if you count cards or rob the casino, but if you play
                it straight, you're a damn fool.
