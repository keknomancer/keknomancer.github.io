                Support local business! And I'm not using that as an exploitative marketing tactic. I don't just mean me. 
                There are thousands of businesses all over canada that would love to sell you whatever you need and provide you with whatever service you require.
                Remember that every time you order from China or hire someone from India to program or design you something, that money is leaving Canada and it's not coming back.
                You get exactly what you pay for. Everyone in every industry thought they were geniuses for outsourcing to China until "supply chain disruptions" caused every chinese distributor to jack their prices up 200%.
                Think outsourcing programming to India is a great idea? Use an active directory in a government database.
                All it takes is one Shenzen board meeting about margins or a stuck boat in a canal and you're caught with your pants down because you thought you could save a buck outsourcing.
                China doesn't need business from Canada, neither does India or Vietnam. The population of Canada is less than the population of California. 
                But do you know who does?
                
                Canada.
