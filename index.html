                Regardless of your political outlook I can assume with confidence that you have - at the very least - contempt for whoever sits on the other side of the fence from you. If you're a die-hard conservative or a bleeding-heart liberal, or even a moderate that mainly dislikes fringe political minorities, what you need to understand is: the people 'playing for the other team', that you hate or at least view with disgust, are just as much of a victim of the system as you are. Modern politics has been transformed into a team sport where truth and logic are distributed between the two to keep the layman from seeing the full picture. You are being manipulated into fighting your neighbor, identity politics is a pendulum that swings back and forth so that each 'team' can have their day, you cheer for your intellectual football team when a gigantic corporation pretends to share your values, only for them to give a platform to the opposite as soon as whatever you agree with is no longer popular. No corporation has any real value or goal outside of increasing shareholder value and anything else they do is to facilitate that by manipulating people into 'voting with their wallet'. No, Mark Zuckerberg doesn't give a shit about the 'woke mob' and his recent transformation from Kraftwerk reject to alpha sigma kappa pit viper 5 on diesel and a tin of zyn is entirely performative. The values he and his company shared previously (conveniently, on the other side of the spectrum, when it was popular) are just as so. The only entities who care less about you than corporations do is the government, because you can't boycott taxes.<br>

                I wouldn't consider myself to be much smarter than the average Canadian, and my life is more or less on par for a white guy with back issues. I commute every day from my run-down house in my car I can't really afford to my job in Toronto which doesn't really pay all that well. What separates someone like you reading this from someone like me writing this is that I understand and accept that all of the things that I stand to lose from doing or saying something about our corporate feudalist society I will end up losing anyway as wealth inequality continues to increase and I can no longer afford to keep them. This is not a manifesto, this is a warning. The beatings will continue until the hand that holds the stick is no longer attached to an arm. Senseless acts of violence like burning down a Starbucks or shooting up a place will only further their agenda, if you want to make a difference, take it straight to The Man. Become an independent journalist, put up posters, educate your social circle on the real issues, cut the fiber connection or destroy the transformer feeding a datacenter belonging to a company like Meta, Palantir, etc.<br>

                Identity politics is being propagated because the moment you let go of it you can see how many of the real offenders are universally evil. There is no ideological component to water theft, pollution, or worker exploitation. Your suffering is to make a number go up, and nothing else. Go do something that will put a double digit percentage hit in a stock. Hell, go do something that'll make them go bankrupt.<br>

                Big or small, say something, do something. Talk to your neighbors. Whatever it is, you'll know you're on the right path when CSIS starts taking your friends out for drinks and asking them shit. Build strong bonds and the next time you see someone ideologically opposed to you, remember they're being manipulated and subjugated just as much as you.<br>
